# Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the risk of hospital readmission for patients with chronic conditions. The model helps healthcare providers take early action to improve outcomes.

##  Problem Statement
Predict whether a patient is likely to be readmitted within 30 days after discharge using medical and hospital admission data.

##  Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for web app)
- Google Colab (for model training)

##  Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest (used in final deployment)

##  Features Used
- Age, Gender, Stay Length, Admission Type, Medical Condition, Medication, Test Results, etc.

##  Streamlit App
A simple web app where users can input patient data and get a readmission risk prediction with confidence.

##  Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hospital-Readmission-Prediction.git
cd Hospital-Readmission-Prediction

Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py
